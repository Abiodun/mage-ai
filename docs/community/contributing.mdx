## Set up development environment

### MacOS or Linux

1. Clone the Mage-ai repository:
   ```bash
   % git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai.git
   ```
2. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   % cd mage-ai
   % ./scripts/init.sh [project_name]
   ```
3. Run the below script to build the Docker image and run all the services:
   ```bash
   % ./scripts/dev.sh [project]
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Windows

Some additional installations would be needed, as listed below:

#### Install Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

* To install WSL2 on Windows, open Command Prompt as admin and run
```bash
$ wsl –install
```
It will install all the WSL2 components and the default Ubuntu Linux distro.
* To view a list of available WSL distros to install on Windows, run
```bash
wsl --list --online
```
* To install a specific distro, run
```bash
wsl –install -d <Distro>
```

#### Install Docker and Enable WSL Integration

Follow the instructions given at Get started with Docker remote containers on WSL2,
to install the Docker desktop and set up WSL integration in Docker. 

To confirm that Docker is available in WSL, open a WSL distribution (e.g. Ubuntu) terminal and run:
```bash
$ docker --version
$ docker run hello-world
```

#### Install Pip and Pre-commit in WSL

To install `pip` and `pre-commit`, run the following commands 
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ sudo apt install pre-commit
```

#### Install Anaconda

Go to https://repo.continuum.io/archive to find the list of Anaconda releases
and select the release you want, e.g., Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh.

From a `WSL` terminal, run:
```bash
$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Close the terminal and reopen it to reload `.bash` configs. To test that it worked, run
```bash
$ which python
```
It should print a path that has an "anaconda" in it.

#### Install Poetry

In a WSL terminal, run
```bash
$ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
To test out the Peotry installation, run
```bash
$ poetry --version
```

Clone and start Mage using the same steps listed above for "MacOS or Linux".

For all these operating systems, more information about setting up your local environment
for development is available [here](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/blob/master/README_dev.md).

### Errors

#### Permission denied

If you get an error relating to permission denied when trying to execute a script,
it might have something to do with SELinux.

Two or more containers are trying to mount the same volume. With SELinux it’s not possible without
the `z` option.

For more information about using the `z` option,
read [Docker’s documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).

## Debugging

Instead of using `breakpoint()`, add the following line to your code where you
want a debug:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

Attach to running container to use debugger. To get the container ID, run
`docker ps` and look in the `NAMES` column.

```bash
docker attach [container_id]
```
