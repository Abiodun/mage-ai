This section of our documentation contains helpful guides and tutorials to getting started with Mage.

We welcome contributions from our community. If you would like to contribute your own guides or content, we encourage that as well! It's written entirely in Markdown and _very_ user friendly.

At the bottom of every doc, there's a link to edit the page on GitHub. Click that link and you'll be taken to the Markdown file for that page. You can edit the file directly in your browser and submit a pull request.
